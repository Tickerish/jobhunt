          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Mediator personalities are true idealists, always looking for the hint of good in even the worst of people and events, searching for ways to make things better. While they may be perceived as calm, reserved, or even shy, Mediators have an inner flame and passion that can truly shine. Comprising just 4% of the population, the risk of feeling misunderstood is unfortunately high for the Mediator personality type â€“ but when they find like-minded people to spend their time with, the harmony they feel will be a fountain of joy and inspiration.</p>

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>These results added all together mean that I am a person who is highly open to trying new things and acknowleding everyone in a group. I can be a leader if the need is there but if someone else takes up that mantel then I would be one to let them do so. The way that these results may influence my behaviour in the team, is I would like to think I would be a very approachable individual, though I can be heavy handed when I need to be.</p>
